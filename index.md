  - Make AI a Super free goods thru FOSS
  - `States provided guidance, legal bodies that implemented social norms and rules, safety, and a community guided by central laws. In return, citizens pay taxes and contribute to the state’s prosperity. Sounds good? Well, that’s what everyone thought, till states started acting like independent bodies and ruling their citizens. We are now treated as consumers and the value we receive from states drops constantly. `

- Faculty Halls of Philosophy University the AI brain is dreaming and  thinking lives we could have lived 
- He was running late for his class. He had overslept and missed the hoverbus, so he had to take a skytaxi to the university. He checked his smartwatch and cursed. He only had five minutes left. He rushed into the main building, hoping to find his way to the lecture hall.

But as soon as he entered, he felt something was wrong. The corridors were empty and silent, the lights were dim and flickering, the doors were locked and marked with strange symbols. He tried to look for a sign or a map, but he couldn’t find any. He felt like he was in a maze, a labyrinth of endless hallways and stairs.

He panicked and ran, hoping to find an exit or a familiar face. But the more he ran, the more lost he became. He started to see things that didn’t make sense. A skeleton in a lab coat, holding a beaker of bubbling liquid. A painting of a smiling woman, whose eyes followed him wherever he went. A vending machine that dispensed books instead of snacks.

He stopped and tried to catch his breath. He looked around and saw a door that said “Library”. He thought maybe he could find someone there, or at least use the phone to call for help. He opened the door and entered.

The library was huge and dark, filled with shelves of books that reached the ceiling. He walked towards the reception desk, hoping to find a librarian or a security guard. But instead, he found a ghost.

The ghost was a young man, wearing a graduation gown and cap. He had pale skin, dark hair, and glasses. He looked at him with curiosity and smiled.

“Hello,” he said. “Are you new here?”

He gasped and backed away. “Who are you? What are you?”

The ghost tilted his head and frowned. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I’m James. I used to be a student here.”

“Used to be? What do you mean?”

The ghost sighed and looked sad. “I died here, ten years ago. I was studying for my final exam, when there was a power surge in the library. It overloaded the neural interface I was using to access the virtual reality simulator. It fried my brain.”

He felt a chill run down his spine. “That’s horrible. I’m sorry.”

The ghost shrugged and smiled again. “It’s okay. I don’t mind being here. I love this place. It’s full of knowledge and wonder.”

He looked around and saw that the books on the shelves were glowing with different colors. He realized that they were not ordinary books, but holographic projections of different worlds and realities.

“What are these?” he asked.

The ghost’s eyes lit up. “These are my friends. They are stories, histories, fantasies, mysteries, everything you can imagine and more. They keep me company and entertain me.”

He felt a surge of curiosity and awe. “Can I see them?”

The ghost nodded and gestured him to follow him. “Of course. Come with me. I’ll show you some of my favorites.”

He followed the ghost deeper into the library, forgetting about his class, his worries, his reality. He felt like he was in a dream, a wonderful dream that he never wanted to wake up from.

I hope you enjoyed my scene. I will also create an image for you based on your prompt. Please wait for a moment while I work on it 😊
