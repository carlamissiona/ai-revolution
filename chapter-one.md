He was running late for his class. He had overslept and missed the hoverbus, so he had to take a skytaxi to the university. He checked his smartwatch and cursed. He only had five minutes left. He rushed into the main building, hoping to find his way to the lecture hall.

But as soon as he entered, he felt something was wrong. The corridors were empty and silent, the lights were dim and flickering, the doors were locked and marked with strange symbols. Damian tried to look for a sign or a map, but he couldn’t find any. He felt like he was in a maze, a labyrinth of endless hallways and stairs.

He panicked and ran, hoping to find an exit or a familiar face. But the more he ran, the more lost he became. He started to see things that didn’t make sense. A skeleton in a lab coat, holding a beaker of bubbling liquid. A painting of a smiling woman, whose eyes followed him wherever he went. A vending machine that dispensed books instead of snacks.

He stopped and tried to catch his breath. He looked around and saw a door that said “Library”. He thought maybe he could find someone there, or at least use the phone to call for help. He opened the door and entered.

The library was huge and dark, filled with shelves of books that reached the ceiling. He walked towards the reception desk, hoping to find a librarian or a security guard. But instead, he found a ghost.

The ghost was a young man, wearing a graduation gown and cap. He had pale skin, dark hair, and glasses. He looked at him with curiosity and smiled.

“Hello,” he said. “Are you new here?”

He gasped and backed away. “Who are you? What are you?”

The ghost tilted his head and frowned. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I’m James. I used to be a student here.”

“Used to be? What do you mean?”

The ghost sighed and looked sad. “I died here, ten years ago. I was studying for my final exam, when there was a power surge in the library. It overloaded the neural interface I was using to access the virtual reality simulator. It fried my brain.”

He felt a chill run down his spine. “That’s horrible. I’m sorry.”

The ghost shrugged and smiled again. “It’s okay. I don’t mind being here. I love this place. It’s full of knowledge and wonder.”

He looked around and saw that the books on the shelves were glowing with different colors. He realized that they were not ordinary books, but looking like strange lights orholographic projections. This isn't real Damian thought or the place is just a dreamy hallucination of his mind. He tried to recall the last episode of Last Sky Watch and then tried to remember if he lock his pod too.

“What are these?” he asked. "Where am I" When he look up he noticed the book shelves end are reaching up the cieling and are glowing in outlines of like glittering lights

The ghost’s eyes lit up. “These are my friends. They are stories, histories, fantasies, mysteries, everything you can imagine and more. They keep me company and entertain me.”

He felt a surge of curiosity and awe. “But this is my school and our library”

The ghost nodded and gestured him to follow him. “Of course. Come with me. I’ll show you some of my favorites.”

He followed the ghost deeper into the library, forgetting about his class, his worries, his reality. He felt like he was in a dream, a wonderful dream that he never wanted to wake up from. 

`The room was dimly lit by the holographic projections of various planets and stars. A group of people, wearing sleek suits and earpieces, were seated around a circular table, each with a tablet in front of them. They were the representatives of the United Earth Federation, the Solar System Alliance, the Martian Republic, and the Outer Rim Coalition. They were here to discuss the fate of the newly discovered habitable world in the Alpha Centauri system.

“Let me make this clear,” said the UEF delegate, a middle-aged man with a stern face. “This planet belongs to humanity as a whole. It is our duty to explore it, colonize it, and protect it from any potential threats. We cannot afford to let petty rivalries and selfish interests get in the way of our destiny.”

“That’s easy for you to say,” retorted the SSA delegate, a young woman with a fiery expression. “You have the largest and most powerful fleet in the galaxy. You can claim any planet you want without any opposition. But what about the rest of us? Don’t we have a say in this matter? Don’t we have a right to share in this opportunity?”

“You do have a say,” interjected the MR delegate, a calm and composed man with a cybernetic eye. “But you also have to be realistic. This planet is not a free-for-all. It has its own ecosystem, its own resources, its own challenges. We need to cooperate and coordinate our efforts if we want to make the best use of it. We need to establish a common framework and a joint authority to oversee its development.”

“That sounds reasonable,” agreed the ORC delegate, a grizzled and rugged man with a scarred face. “But how do we ensure that this authority is fair and balanced? How do we prevent any one faction from dominating or exploiting it? How do we respect the diversity and autonomy of our cultures and values?”

“That’s what we’re here to figure out,” said the UEF delegate, with a hint of impatience. “We have to find a way to work together, or else we risk losing this planet to someone else. Someone who might not be as friendly or as benevolent as we are.”

He glanced at the hologram of the planet, which showed a green and blue sphere with swirling clouds and continents. It was a beautiful sight, but also a tempting one. A prize that could spark a war or forge a peace.`
