He was running late for his class. He had overslept and missed the hoverbus, so he had to take a skytaxi to the university. He checked his smartwatch and cursed. He only had five minutes left. He rushed into the main building, hoping to find his way to the lecture hall.

But as soon as he entered, he felt something was wrong. The corridors were empty and silent, the lights were dim and flickering, the doors were locked and marked with strange symbols. Damian tried to look for a sign or a map, but he couldn’t find any. He felt like he was in a maze, a labyrinth of endless hallways and stairs.

He panicked and ran, hoping to find an exit or a familiar face. But the more he ran, the more lost he became. He started to see things that didn’t make sense. A skeleton in a lab coat, holding a beaker of bubbling liquid. A painting of a smiling woman, whose eyes followed him wherever he went. A vending machine that dispensed books instead of snacks.

He stopped and tried to catch his breath. He looked around and saw a door that said “Library”. He thought maybe he could find someone there, or at least use the phone to call for help. He opened the door and entered.

The library was huge and dark, filled with shelves of books that reached the ceiling. He walked towards the reception desk, hoping to find a librarian or a security guard. But instead, he found a ghost.

The ghost was an old man, wearing an old ornament gown of a priests. He had pale skin, dark hair, and glasses. He looked at him with curiosity and smiled.

“Hello,” he said. “Are you new here?”

He gasped and backed away. “Who are you? What are you?”

The ghost tilted his head and frowned. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I’m Augustine. Im doing my service here in Rome.”

“Rome? What do you mean? This place is Starship Gamma” Damian felt a chill run down his spine. 


The ghost shrugged and smiled again. “It’s okay, Calm down. You look strange. I don't think you can explain those outlandish clothing.”

He looked around and saw that the books on the shelves were glowing with different colors. He realized that they were not ordinary books, but looking like strange lights or holographic projections. This isn't real Damian thought or the place is just a dreamy hallucination of his mind. He tried to recall the last episode of Last Sky Watch and then tried to remember if he locked his pod too.

“What are these?” he asked. "Where am I" When he look up he noticed the book shelves end are reaching up the cieling and are glowing in outlines of like glittering lights. 

The ghost’s eyes lit up. ""

He felt a surge of curiosity and awe. “But this is my school and our library” 

[...]


He followed the ghost deeper into the library, forgetting about his class, his worries, his reality. He felt like he was in a dream, a wonderful dream that he never wanted to wake up from.
