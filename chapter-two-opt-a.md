NEXT PAGE CHOICE A `The room was dimly lit by the holographic projections of various planets and stars. A group of people, wearing sleek suits and earpieces, were seated around a circular table, each with a tablet in front of them. They were the representatives of the United Earth Federation, the Solar System Alliance, the Martian Republic, and the Outer Rim Coalition. They were here to discuss the fate of the newly discovered habitable world in the Alpha Centauri system.

“Let me make this clear,” said the UEF delegate, a middle-aged man with a stern face. “This planet belongs to humanity as a whole. It is our duty to explore it, colonize it, and protect it from any potential threats. We cannot afford to let petty rivalries and selfish interests get in the way of our destiny.”

“That’s easy for you to say,” retorted the SSA delegate, a young woman with a fiery expression. “You have the largest and most powerful fleet in the galaxy. You can claim any planet you want without any opposition. But what about the rest of us? Don’t we have a say in this matter? Don’t we have a right to share in this opportunity?”

“You do have a say,” interjected the MR delegate, a calm and composed man with a cybernetic eye. “But you also have to be realistic. This planet is not a free-for-all. It has its own ecosystem, its own resources, its own challenges. We need to cooperate and coordinate our efforts if we want to make the best use of it. We need to establish a common framework and a joint authority to oversee its development.”

“That sounds reasonable,” agreed the ORC delegate, a grizzled and rugged man with a scarred face. “But how do we ensure that this authority is fair and balanced? How do we prevent any one faction from dominating or exploiting it? How do we respect the diversity and autonomy of our cultures and values?”

“That’s what we’re here to figure out,” said the UEF delegate, with a hint of impatience. “We have to find a way to work together, or else we risk losing this planet to someone else. Someone who might not be as friendly or as benevolent as we are.”

He glanced at the hologram of the planet, which showed a green and blue sphere with swirling clouds and continents. It was a beautiful sight, but also a tempting one. A prize that could spark a war or forge a peace.`
